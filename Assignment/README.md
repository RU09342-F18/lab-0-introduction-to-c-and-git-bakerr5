## Description
This project uses a math function to perform different calculations using two numbers and an operator
As an example, the main function uses STDIN to get values and pass them to the math function
The math function is capable of computing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, left shift, right shift, bitwise and, bitwise or, bitwise xor, and bitwise not
## Files
The files necessary for running this file are located in the 'Assignment' directory
The math function and example function are found in math.c
## Execution
To execute this project, run math.c through a c compiler such as the one found at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php
Remember to enter the operator, the first number, and the second number as inputs on seperate lines, in that order
